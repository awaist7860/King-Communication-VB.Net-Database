# King-Communication-VB.Net-Database
This is the database that is made with vb.net and it wirtes and read from a text file.
This is a databse that I made for a client who needed a system that could manage his inventory of parts and also the orders of customers.
The address of the business is 69 King Street, Dukinfield SK16 4NQ.
To contact the business you can email them on kingcommunication69@gmail.com and you can ring the owner Waseem on Telephone: 0161 465 9878 or on mobile: 07466 419 169.
The system that Iâ€™m going to make is going to store all the data of phones, laptops, games console and all the different parts the owner has in stock. I will store all the details for each item in files and make a database in VB.Net and link all the files together with primary keys.
This business is a mobile phone repair shop that also repairs laptops and games consoles, and they do phone unlocking and they also sell electronics such as laptops, phones and games console. The business has a wide variety of skills to fix almost all electronics, so that the customer only has to go one place to get there problem fixed.
